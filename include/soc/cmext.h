 * DRIVER/DEVICE INITIALIZATION
 * ----------------------------------------
 * 
 * Step One: Device/Revision Ids
 * -------------------------------
 * Each Broadcom device can be identified by 2 values -- its
 * Device ID and its Revision ID. The combination of these two values
 * specify a particular Broadcom device. 
 *
 * Before the BCM driver is assigned the task of driving 
 * a Broadcom device, you must ascertain the Device ID and the 
 * Revision ID for the device to be driven (for a PCI device, these
 * are in the PCI Configuration Space). 
 *
 *
 * After the Device ID and Revision ID are discovered (typically at
 * system initialization time), you should query the SOC driver to 
 * discover whether it supports the discovered device using the following 
 * function:
 */

/*
 * Syntax:     int soc_cm_device_supported(uint16 device_id,
 *					   uint8 revision_id)
 *
 * Purpose:    Determine whether this driver supports a particular device. 
 * 
 * Parameters:
 *             device_id    -- The 16-bit device id for the device. 
 *             revision_id  -- The 8-bit revision id for the device. 
 * 
 * Returns:
 *             0 if the device is supported. 
 *             < 0 if the device is not supported. 
 */

extern int soc_cm_device_supported(uint16 dev_id, uint8 rev_id);

/*
 * Step Two: Device Creation
 * -----------------------------------------
 * When you have a device that the SOC driver supports, 
 * You must create a driver device for it. 
 * You create a driver device by calling cm_device_create() with
 * the device and revision ids. 
 *
 * cm_device_create() will return a handle that should be used
 * when referring to the device in the future. 

 * cm_device_create_id() might be used if application want to 
 * force a speicifc handle when referring to the device in the future.
 * Passing -1 as a "dev" parameter will force api to allocate a new handle.
 *
 * cm_dev_num_set() might be used to associate the CM device to a
 * BDE/DRD handle if the CM handle and the BDE/DRD handle are not consistent.

/*
 * Step Three: Device Initialization
 * -----------------------------------------
 * After you have initialized a device, 
 * you must provide several accessor functions that will be
 * used by the SOC driver to communicate with the device at 
 * the lowest level -- the SOC driver will access the device
 * through these routines, and these routines only. 
 *
 * You provide these access vectors to the driver
 * by filling in the 'cm_device_t' structure. See <cmtypes.h>
